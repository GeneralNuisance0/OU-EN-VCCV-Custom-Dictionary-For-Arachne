# Open Utau EN VCCV Phonemizer Custom Dictionary for Arachne
Custom Dictionary for the English VCCV Phonemizer for OpenUtau, converted from snowphones' Lyric Parser dictionary, and further adapted to suit the Arachne -TARANTULA II- voicebank. It contains changes to account for:
- The cot-caught merger
- Canadian raising
- A more natural, relaxed pronunciation style
- Several errors in the original plugin (ie: consonants that should have been voiced but were unvoiced)
- Glottal stops
- Dark/Syllabic Ls
